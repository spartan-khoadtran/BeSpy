We fall into this routine full of tasks that drain us — not because they’re hard, but because they feel meaningless. And suddenly, being a founder doesn’t feel anything like what we imagined.",

But if I reflect on my own experience building OskarOS, I’d argue that the core challenge isn’t chronic understimulation — it’s navigating the messy, emotional terrain between the initial idea and meaningful traction.When you're building something complex and long-term (in my case, a SaaS for service-based businesses), you’re rarely bored. You're overwhelmed. You're deep in the weeds, juggling a hundred micro-decisions, never quite sure if what you’re doing today will matter three months from now.For me, the danger zone wasn’t the tasks being too boring — it was the emotional toll of executing consistently without external validation. Not knowing if users will come. Not knowing if the design will convert. Not knowing if your tenth cold DM this week will land. That’s what quietly wears you down. And because you're \"in motion\", it often masquerades as momentum — until you wake up one day and realize you're exhausted and emotionally disconnected from what you’re building.What helped me wasn’t gamifying tasks (although that can be helpful). It was (1) radically narrowing focus, (2) setting shorter feedback loops to generate micro-wins, and (3) being honest about when I was just busy vs. when I was truly moving forward.So while boreout is real, I’d say for many solo founders, what we’re seeing more often is a quiet burnout-through-uncertainty. It doesn’t look dramatic, but it slowly erodes your energy and conviction.Thanks again for opening up this conversation — it’s important that we put more language to the in-between states of building.",
