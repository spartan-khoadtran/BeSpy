This is especially true for AI.\n\n            \n              \n                By\n                    \n                      Channing Allen              \n\n              \n                August 23, 2025\n              \n            \n          \n\n            \n              \n            \n\n      \n\n\n        \n          \n            In 1930, the economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that automation and other expressions of technological progress would lead to a 15-hour workweek by the early 21st century.In his essay Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, he wrote:The economic problem may be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years. ‚Ä¶ Thus for the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem ‚Äî how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him.Now that we're coming up on the 100th anniversary of that essay, it's safe to say Keynes' prediction wasn't just wrong in magnitude, but wrong in direction as well.Many of us today work longer hours than people did in the 1930s, especially today's high earners. And that's not because technology failed to advance, but because the advances were available to everyone. This is a distinction with a difference because for most of us, the purpose of work isn't just to do better in life. It's to do better than others.This is the leverage paradox. New technologies give us greater leverage to do more tasks better. But because this leverage is usually introduced into competitive environments, the result is that we end up having to work just as hard as before (if not harder) to remain competitive and keep up with the joneses.Enter AIBefore AI, we had to beat our competitors to the top of a staircase. It was tricky to climb because we had to ascend the steps manually, writing our own words, designing our own graphics, producing our own sounds, and coding our own software.Now, AI has turned that staircase into an escalator. Which is easier to climb! Yay!Except‚Ä¶ the leverage paradox means we all have to climb way higher to get to the top while competing against many more people.Those who understand this paradox ‚Äî not just intellectually but in a deep, intuitive way ‚Äî are the few who will make it to the top of the escalator. And those who don't will be the ones at the bottom.We're watching this unfold in real time:Claude 4 just refactored my entire codebase in one call.25 tool invocations. 3,000+ new lines. 12 brand new files.It modularized everything. Broke up monoliths. Cleaned up spaghetti.None of it worked.But boy was it beautiful. pic.twitter.com/wvmzh7IeAP‚Äî vas (@vasumanmoza) May 25, 2025We can all now produce blog posts, social media images, lifelike videos, and even halfbaked web apps in under 5 minutes.Problem is, the lion's share of this content is utter slop. Including stuff that might've been acceptable before the web got flooded by AI models that all talk the same, draw the same, think the same, and hallucinate the same.It feels like AI slop is everywhere:Search engine results pages filled with low-effort, SEO-farm articlesAn endless conveyor belt of Studio-Ghibli-style images on social feedsAI reply spam on every comment sectionFaceless channels on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram splicing lazy stock footage with same AI narration voices from ElevenLabsIt's easy to recognize this problem and to make snarky comments about it online. But as the saying goes:You aren't stuck in traffic; you are traffic.Resisting the urge to turn your brain off and output an additional unit of AI slop for the internet to roll its eyes at is hard. Because it's hard to adopt a new technology while continuing to put in the same hours and the same effort you put in before the technology was introduced.But that's why the leverage paradox is the leverage paradox. And that's why only a small fraction of us will get ahead with AI while the rest of us fall behind.Winning in the AI eraI have two pieces of advice for indie hackers who don't want to get seduced into complaceny with all the new AI tools:1. \"One-hundred-shot\" your projectsOne of the main reasons for all the AI slop is that everyone's trying to \"one-shot\" everything. Which is a huge missed opportunity.Generative AI gives us incredible first drafts to work with, but few people want to put in the additional effort it requires to make work that people love.So instead of trying to one-shot your next blog post",

And she just launched DubX ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing.Here's Anuja on how she did it. üëáContentsBuilding a global tech business from IndiaStarting upBuilding a tech moatTargeting prosumersGood timingGrowth loops that workedCharging from day oneParting adviceWhat's next?Building a global tech business from IndiaI‚Äôve been a part of India‚Äôs buzzing startup ecosystem for almost a decade, working across different companies in the SaaS world. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how the energy and ambition here have grown, and I‚Äôve always carried the dream of building something large and meaningful from India.In 2021, that dream took shape with Dubverse, a platform that helps creators, enterprises, and educators make their videos multilingual through AI-powered dubbing and subtitling. Our vision has always been simple but bold: to build a global technology business from India that competes at the highest stage.Today, Dubverse has a high 6-figure ARR. It has powered more than 4M videos and 11M dubbed minutes for creators worldwide, with a growing base of paying customers across industries. It‚Äôs the most exciting time to be building from India, and we‚Äôre just getting started!And I'm excited to announce the launch of DubX, the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing. Until now, dubbing has been a clunky workflow: You‚Äôd input text, the system would convert it into speech, and that‚Äôs it. The voice was flat, the emotion got lost, and the translated video felt disconnected from the original. DubX changes that completely.Starting upThe early days of Dubverse were some of the most exciting. After my co-founder, Varshul, and I started, we quickly connected with two other builders who were experimenting in a very similar space. We met online, things just clicked, and they ended up moving cities to join us.That kind of serendipity gave the founding team a lot of momentum and belief in what we were building.Varshul and I had known each other for almost a decade. He‚Äôs the technical brain behind Dubverse, while I‚Äôm the one out talking to people and opening doors. Together, we built the first scrappy demo: a simple form where you could input a video and instantly see it translated into another language.This was back in 2020, before the AI hype cycle we‚Äôre in today. For most people, experiencing that ‚Äúmagic‚Äù for the first time felt almost unreal.I‚Äôll never forget one of our earliest demos with a creator. Midway through, they literally jumped out of their chair. They told us, ‚ÄúThis takes us weeks to do normally‚Ä¶ how are you doing it in real time?‚Äù Those moments validated that we were onto something. It gave our small team the energy to keep pushing forward until we found product-market fit.Building a tech moatFrom day one, our north star has been clear: If the internet is dominated by English, Dubverse should unlock everything non-English. That clarity shaped our tech decisions.In the beginning, we leaned on off-the-shelf models to validate the idea and test whether people would actually care about multilingual content. Once we saw the reactions and knew we were sitting on a goldmine, we went back to the drawing board: What could become our long-term moat?The answer was clear: building our own foundational speech models, especially for non-English languages.Voice quality is everything in dubbing. A dubbed video is only as good as the voiceover; if it‚Äôs not natural and engaging, nobody will consume it. That‚Äôs why we invested heavily in our own speech models, while also combining them with the best external models available to ensure creators get the smoothest experience.The evolution of the stack in just a few years has been mind-boggling. I still remember when Whisper came out. Within seven days, we had it integrated into Dubverse, instantly expanding language coverage and boosting transcription quality. Those moments have felt like riding the wave of AI innovation from the front row.The hardest challenge, from a technical perspective, has been data. We work in obscure languages, where high-quality datasets are scarce. But thanks to the wide variety of users on our platform, we‚Äôve been able to accumulate a corpus of more than 250,000 hours of data, which now powers our model training. That‚Äôs the kind of advantage that compounds over time.Targeting prosumersOne of the best decisions we ma",

Eventually, cold outreach is what brought in our buyer.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

I currently run an AI voice company called Rosie, and we hit $1M ARR within eight months.The idea for Rosie came out of a pivot. I was running another product called Rally. We raised a seed round and a Series A, but unfortunately, that company just wasn't growing fast enough. We had gotten to a few hundred thousand in ARR and we were closing deals, but it just felt like everything was harder than it should have been.AI was popping, and I thought to myself, \"You know what? We've got a great team, we've got money in the bank, let's pivot and keep going.\"¬†\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

So he rebuilt, rebranded, and relaunched it as Lovable.Eight months later, it's bringing in $100M ARR.Here's Anton on how he did it. üëáContents$100M ARR in eight monthsScaling problemsDrivers of explosive growthReduce plan complexityThe advantage of locationYour team is everythingWhat's next?$100M ARR in eight monthsMy background is in physics, which I studied at university and spent time at CERN before working as an engineer at some of Sweden's most exciting tech companies. I was a founding engineer at Sana and CTO of Depict before starting Lovable.I've always felt that the ability to create and build things is the highest form of having a positive impact on the world. And in the modern world, building software is the best way of doing that.However, the biggest barrier to building businesses is coding. 99% of people have great ideas and can execute on a business, but they don't know how to write code.I realized that AI could change that. AI allows us to unlock the potential of ideas for everyone. So I put together this command-line interface called GPT-Engineer in one weekend to prove it and the reaction from the developer community was immediate and overwhelming. Since then, GPT-Engineer has evolved into Lovable and the customer love has been immense.Lovable is an AI software builder that turns ideas into software in minutes. Anyone from non-technical users to experienced developers and enterprise teams can build with our platform ‚Äî we think of it as the last piece of software anyone will ever need.We launched at the end of 2024 and within eight months, we‚Äôve reached 2M users and $100M ARR.We're shipping new products and features all the time and we're just at the beginning of realizing what the world looks like when everyone can turn their idea into a business in minutes.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

That's not an active user. Personally I think the key question with all these AI apps is not how many users, or how much content its generated, but how much value its generated. How many of the millions of projects created actually do something useful and generate revenue? That's a statistic I would love to see. AI can spit out garbage content and code at record speeds, but the amount of software developed that actually generates value is plummeting incredibly fast. \n\n\n    \n      \n    \n          \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n          \n            Beau Austin\n  ",

That's when I decided I wanted to build my own software. I studied Computer Science, then got some 9-to-5 experience and started freelancing right out of university.I did that until I had saved up enough runway to commit to entrepreneurship fully. By that point, I had already left my home country, Germany, to travel Southeast Asia for two years, where I learned about indie hacking through meeting inspiring people who were already living the dream.At the time, my girlfriend had a physical business, and she was having trouble scaling because of the operational workload. So, I built a tool to solve it, but didn't get much traction beyond her business. After a year, I went back to experimenting.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

Since then, I‚Äôve built and flipped a few micro‚ÄëSaaS experiments and, alongside my cofounder Mike Heap, founded My AskAI in early 2023.My AskAI allows any company to create and launch their own AI customer support agent that plugs right into the support tools they‚Äôre already using (Intercom, Zendesk, etc.). Right now we handle 75k+ support chats a month and pull in around $40k MRR (~$500k ARR).

Not for cold pitching, but by showing up, answering questions, and sharing a simple visual or short demo when it‚Äôs relevant. As for Bubble, the biggest thing I‚Äôve heard from other builders is to be mindful of scaling . It‚Äôs great for getting something live quickly, but you‚Äôll want to plan ahead for traffic spikes so you‚Äôre not scrambling later. The upside is you can move incredibly fast and get feedback before sinking months into development. I think the support and community there are strong if you‚Äôre willing to poke around and ask when you‚Äôre stuck.\n\n\n    \n      \n    \n          \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n          \n            Sierra Snedge\n          \n\n",

So he built Adaptify. And exactly two years later, he's bringing in $2M ARR.Here's Dominic on how he did it. üëáContentsAI FOMOPivoting and pivoting againBuilding RAG before it was coolThe advantage of a standard stack3-tier paid adsUsing the \"Value Ladder\"Automate everythingThree pieces of adviceWhat's next?Follow alongAI FOMOI'm Dominic. I'm Dutch, but the Netherlands always felt too small for me, so I studied engineering physics in Germany and Brazil, and later worked in London as a space engineer for Airbus and as a data analyst in a fintech startup. Around that time, I met my wife, who is Chinese.As I'd always loved language learning, I tried to learn Mandarin but hit a roadblock until I found an obscure method using mnemonic techniques that finally worked to learn those weird characters! I turned this method into a product (Traverse), which was my first SaaS project that made enough money to quit my job during Covid.Then, in early 2023, as I interacted more with ChatGPT, I turned from an AI skeptic into an AI enthusiast. Like many founders at that time, I caught AI FOMO ‚Äî that fear of missing out on the AI revolution and the strong conviction that AI would change our ways of doing business for good.So, together with a friend, we started exploring making AI products. After a few months, that turned into Adaptify, an AI SaaS that completely automates SEO delivery and reporting for agencies, and has grown from 0 to 2M ARR in less than two years.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

He quickly found a big opportunity and built for it. After four years of building ‚Äî and only 6 months since public launch ‚Äî¬†Augment Code's AI coding agent is estimated to hit $50M+ within the year.Here's Igor on how he built ahead of the curve. üëáContentsLighting the fuseShipping two big rocksSecure and scalable stacksBuild for next yearBreaking through in a crowded marketA \"try first\" modelBet forwardWhat's next?Lighting the fuseI grew up in Slovakia in the late 1980s, hacking on a Czechoslovak PMD-85 my mom brought home from work. When communism in Czechoslovakia collapsed in 1989, we could travel across the border to Vienna, and my parents bought me a Commodore 64. Those machines ‚Äî and the BASIC books my parents found for me ‚Äî lit the fuse for a lifelong obsession with computers.I taught myself to program and also worked part-time as a laborer at a fish plant in high school and early college. I studied computer science at the University of British Columbia, performed well in programming competitions, and ultimately spent eight years building distributed-storage systems at Pure Storage.In late 2021, I left Pure to explore large-language models. The leap felt risky, but my wife backed the adventure: ‚ÄúGive it a chance ‚Äî you can always go back to storage,‚Äù she said. GPT-3 had hinted that language models could reason about code. I prototyped on a single GPU, joined open-source research groups, and saw flashes of something useful ‚Äî models that could edit or explain unfamiliar files. The conviction hardened when our early context-aware completions produced answers no other tool could match.That exploration became Augment Code, and a year later, real customers felt that same ‚Äúaha‚Äù the first time Augment surfaced the exact function buried 10,000 lines away. Today, we're an AI coding platform that helps professional engineers ship real software inside huge, fast-moving repositories. We‚Äôre venture-backed and growing extremely fast, but we intentionally keep absolute revenue figures private. Our board has hinted at revenue goals for the year north of $50M ‚Äî I‚Äôll neither confirm nor deny.¬†\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

And she just launched DubX ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing.Here's Anuja on how she did it. üëáContentsBuilding a global tech business from IndiaStarting upBuilding a tech moatTargeting prosumersGood timingGrowth loops that workedCharging from day oneParting adviceWhat's next?Building a global tech business from IndiaI‚Äôve been a part of India‚Äôs buzzing startup ecosystem for almost a decade, working across different companies in the SaaS world. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how the energy and ambition here have grown, and I‚Äôve always carried the dream of building something large and meaningful from India.In 2021, that dream took shape with Dubverse, a platform that helps creators, enterprises, and educators make their videos multilingual through AI-powered dubbing and subtitling. Our vision has always been simple but bold: to build a global technology business from India that competes at the highest stage.Today, Dubverse has a high 6-figure ARR. It has powered more than 4M videos and 11M dubbed minutes for creators worldwide, with a growing base of paying customers across industries. It‚Äôs the most exciting time to be building from India, and we‚Äôre just getting started!And I'm excited to announce the launch of DubX, the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing. Until now, dubbing has been a clunky workflow: You‚Äôd input text, the system would convert it into speech, and that‚Äôs it. The voice was flat, the emotion got lost, and the translated video felt disconnected from the original. DubX changes that completely.Starting upThe early days of Dubverse were some of the most exciting. After my co-founder, Varshul, and I started, we quickly connected with two other builders who were experimenting in a very similar space. We met online, things just clicked, and they ended up moving cities to join us.That kind of serendipity gave the founding team a lot of momentum and belief in what we were building.Varshul and I had known each other for almost a decade. He‚Äôs the technical brain behind Dubverse, while I‚Äôm the one out talking to people and opening doors. Together, we built the first scrappy demo: a simple form where you could input a video and instantly see it translated into another language.This was back in 2020, before the AI hype cycle we‚Äôre in today. For most people, experiencing that ‚Äúmagic‚Äù for the first time felt almost unreal.I‚Äôll never forget one of our earliest demos with a creator. Midway through, they literally jumped out of their chair. They told us, ‚ÄúThis takes us weeks to do normally‚Ä¶ how are you doing it in real time?‚Äù Those moments validated that we were onto something. It gave our small team the energy to keep pushing forward until we found product-market fit.Building a tech moatFrom day one, our north star has been clear: If the internet is dominated by English, Dubverse should unlock everything non-English. That clarity shaped our tech decisions.In the beginning, we leaned on off-the-shelf models to validate the idea and test whether people would actually care about multilingual content. Once we saw the reactions and knew we were sitting on a goldmine, we went back to the drawing board: What could become our long-term moat?The answer was clear: building our own foundational speech models, especially for non-English languages.Voice quality is everything in dubbing. A dubbed video is only as good as the voiceover; if it‚Äôs not natural and engaging, nobody will consume it. That‚Äôs why we invested heavily in our own speech models, while also combining them with the best external models available to ensure creators get the smoothest experience.The evolution of the stack in just a few years has been mind-boggling. I still remember when Whisper came out. Within seven days, we had it integrated into Dubverse, instantly expanding language coverage and boosting transcription quality. Those moments have felt like riding the wave of AI innovation from the front row.The hardest challenge, from a technical perspective, has been data. We work in obscure languages, where high-quality datasets are scarce. But thanks to the wide variety of users on our platform, we‚Äôve been able to accumulate a corpus of more than 250,000 hours of data, which now powers our model training. That‚Äôs the kind of advantage that compounds over time.Targeting prosumersOne of the best decisions we ma",

The product is called Linguix ‚Äî it is an AI writing assistant for knowledge workers. My team and I worked on this product for almost seven years.Just recently, my cofounder and I were acqui-hired by a unicorn! Revenue at the time of the acquisition was around $170k ARR. I can't share the purchase price, but I think I can say that it was the same model that Google used with Windsurf: They bought out my technical cofounder and me, and the company remained a separate, active entity.Finding a way to exit the company was not easy at all!

None of those early ventures took off, but now he's going all-in on LaunchFastPro.Here's Andr√© on how he's doing it. üëáContents20 years in the makingOptimizing the stackThe marketing struggle as an engineerAdvice: Motivation follows actionWhat's next?20 years in the makingI've always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, even as a kid. In fact, I've only ever worked for a traditional company for about three months‚Äîthat's a story for another time.For roughly two decades, I've been teaching computer science and developing web applications for clients. That's what pays the bills.Teaching private classes for bachelor and masters students brings in roughly $3k/mo. And I make roughly $10k/mo building apps.Along the way, I've constantly scanned for problems worth solving. I've tested out plenty of ideas, but I struggled with execution and marketing. Until now. As the saying goes, \"An overnight success is years in the making.\"I launched and made six sales at 50‚Ç¨ each. It's not much, but validates the need. That's why I'm pouring everything into LaunchFastPro, including going from a solo proprietorship to an LLC type company.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

I currently run an AI voice company called Rosie, and we hit $1M ARR within eight months.The idea for Rosie came out of a pivot. I was running another product called Rally. We raised a seed round and a Series A, but unfortunately, that company just wasn't growing fast enough. We had gotten to a few hundred thousand in ARR and we were closing deals, but it just felt like everything was harder than it should have been.AI was popping, and I thought to myself, \"You know what? We've got a great team, we've got money in the bank, let's pivot and keep going.\"¬†\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

He just wanted to build a product in a single weekend, then he'd move on to the next idea.Three years later, Stagetimer is bringing in $20k/mo. He never made it to Idea #2.Here's Lukas on how he did it. üëáContentsFinding an ideaFrom side hustle to main hustleUgly and basicGetting quality feedbackGrowth via Google and PLGNailing the business modelKeep it simpleWhat's next?Finding an ideaI recorded every idea I had for two years. Everything from \"Funny Posters for Toilet Doors\" to \"Website Generator for Restaurants.\"I thought there were 2-3 promising ideas. But I decided to start with the simplest idea.The simplest idea was one that came to me during a visit to a friend's video studio. I watched him jump up, run to another room to start a timer on an old laptop, then dash back to his video mixer. I thought, \"Surely there's a better solution\" ‚Äî but when I searched online, I only found outdated desktop software that looked like Windows 98.As a web developer, this seemed like such an easy problem to solve. I had always wanted to build my own product anyway, so I put it on that idea list. And since it was simple enough to build in a weekend, that's what I eventually started withI never got to idea number two.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

So he created something reusable to scratch his own itch.Then, on a whim, he made it available to the public. And three years later, this side hustle ‚Äî Supastarter ‚Äî is bringing in $12k/mo.Here's Jonathan on how he did it. üëáContentsScratching his own itchConstant iterationThe Benefits of Building in Public on Twitter/XDon't underprice your productWhat's next?Scratching his own itchI started freelancing in web development when I was 16 years old. I went to school, worked at multiple companies, and worked my way up to become a web architect. But ultimately, I found that the slow processes of working in a large team weren't for me.On the side, I was still freelancing and working on smaller projects for customers ‚Äî my friend and I had a small agency. We found ourselves spending too much time on boilerplate code when starting new customer projects, so I started building a reusable codebase with our common tools and best practices. This was the initial version of Supastarter.After a few weeks, I thought I might just try selling the boilerplate online. I built a simple website and added a Stripe link with a price of $49. After a week, I got my first sale. Now, almost three years later, this product is one of the most popular starter kits for Next.js and Nuxt. It's selling for $349, and has over 800 customers. It brings in an average of $12k/mo.This allowed me to quit my former full-time job. It also got me a job offer that I couldn't refuse ‚Äî I currently work as a technical lead on a startup called SetSale that was built on Supastarter.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

So he rebuilt, rebranded, and relaunched it as Lovable.Eight months later, it's bringing in $100M ARR.Here's Anton on how he did it. üëáContents$100M ARR in eight monthsScaling problemsDrivers of explosive growthReduce plan complexityThe advantage of locationYour team is everythingWhat's next?$100M ARR in eight monthsMy background is in physics, which I studied at university and spent time at CERN before working as an engineer at some of Sweden's most exciting tech companies. I was a founding engineer at Sana and CTO of Depict before starting Lovable.I've always felt that the ability to create and build things is the highest form of having a positive impact on the world. And in the modern world, building software is the best way of doing that.However, the biggest barrier to building businesses is coding. 99% of people have great ideas and can execute on a business, but they don't know how to write code.I realized that AI could change that. AI allows us to unlock the potential of ideas for everyone. So I put together this command-line interface called GPT-Engineer in one weekend to prove it and the reaction from the developer community was immediate and overwhelming. Since then, GPT-Engineer has evolved into Lovable and the customer love has been immense.Lovable is an AI software builder that turns ideas into software in minutes. Anyone from non-technical users to experienced developers and enterprise teams can build with our platform ‚Äî we think of it as the last piece of software anyone will ever need.We launched at the end of 2024 and within eight months, we‚Äôve reached 2M users and $100M ARR.We're shipping new products and features all the time and we're just at the beginning of realizing what the world looks like when everyone can turn their idea into a business in minutes.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

That's not an active user. Personally I think the key question with all these AI apps is not how many users, or how much content its generated, but how much value its generated. How many of the millions of projects created actually do something useful and generate revenue? That's a statistic I would love to see. AI can spit out garbage content and code at record speeds, but the amount of software developed that actually generates value is plummeting incredibly fast. \n\n\n    \n      \n    \n          \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n          \n            Beau Austin\n  ",

That's not an active user. Personally I think the key question with all these AI apps is not how many users, or how much content its generated, but how much value its generated. How many of the millions of projects created actually do somethin",

One day, in one of my internships, I learned about Uber and decided I wanted to be in tech. So, I moved to San Francisco, attended a coding bootcamp, worked for Lyft, and delivered food on my bicycle to make ends meet.Eventually, I found a job in Utah as a software engineer. I worked for 3 years, saving until I had enough money to live on for about a year with no income. Then, I quit my job in 2022 and focused on entrepreneurship, while extending my runway through freelancing.These days, I'm working full time on Scrape Creators, a real-time social media scraping API.

That's when I decided I wanted to build my own software. I studied Computer Science, then got some 9-to-5 experience and started freelancing right out of university.I did that until I had saved up enough runway to commit to entrepreneurship fully. By that point, I had already left my home country, Germany, to travel Southeast Asia for two years, where I learned about indie hacking through meeting inspiring people who were already living the dream.At the time, my girlfriend had a physical business, and she was having trouble scaling because of the operational workload. So, I built a tool to solve it, but didn't get much traction beyond her business.

Then, since he knew the pains, he started building products for agencies.Now, Queue has a 7-figure ARR. Here's Mas on how he did it. üëáContentsScratch your own itchThe process of building a user-friendly productNot enough marketingParting adviceWhat's next?Scratch your own itchI've been coding since I was 10 years old. I started by building sites for Twitch streamers and startups, and just tinkering with projects for fun. As a first-generation immigrant in the US, it was a way to earn some income early on and really sharpen my skills as an engineer.From there, I started an agency. And now, I'm building Queue ‚Äî a platform that helps agency owners run everything in one place. From billing clients on a subscription to managing projects to sending work out for review and feedback, it‚Äôs all there.We're at a 7-figure ARR and growing every monthWhat really motivated me to get started was thinking back to when I was running my own agency ‚Äî just me, staying up late, trying to make clients happy and get paid. Every time someone launches a new agency on Queue, it brings me right back to that grind.That‚Äôs what drives me. I'm building for those ambitious founders chasing something of their own. I see myself in their journeys, and that keeps me inspired.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

At first I thought it was just another AI model with a quirky name, but after testing it‚Ä¶ this thing hits different.\nMost image AIs are great at creating something new, but they fall apart when you want to:\n\nChange a background üåÜ\nAdd a prop üéí\nAdjust lighting üí°\n\nSuddenly, the person or product you started with looks like a stranger. For anyone running ads, thumbnails, or product visuals, that‚Äôs a nightmare.\nNano Banana‚Äôs edge:\n\nKeeps identity consistent across edits (no more ‚Äúwho is this new person?‚Äù).\nLets you stack multiple changes without drift.\nEven merges two images cleanly.\n\nIt feels less like ‚Äúrandom generations‚Äù and more like Photoshop on steroids.\n\nWhy founders should care\n\nAds/UGC: Same creator, different settings, faster iterations.\nE-com: One model ‚Üí swap outfits, colors, or SKUs without breaking pose.\nYouTube/TikTok: Crank out thumbnail variants from a winning face.\nLocalization: Adapt assets for new markets without remaking everything.\n\nBottom line: it slashes creative churn and speeds up testing.\n\nQuick prompting trick üõ†Ô∏è\nWhen using Nano Banana, layer your edits instead of cramming them all into one prompt:\n\nLock the subject ‚Üí ‚ÄúKeep hairstyle + logo unchanged.‚Äù\nAdd one edit ‚Üí ‚ÄúBackground is neon Shibuya at night.‚Äù\nReassert guardrails ‚Üí ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt alter skin tone or hands.‚Äù\n\nStack and repeat. That‚Äôs how you keep consistency.\n\nWhere Textideo comes in üöÄ\nWe‚Äôve fully integrated Nano Banana into Textideo.\n\nUpload your real photos\nApply stacked edits\nExport clean variants\nKeep history for reproducibility\n\nIf you already use Textideo for AI scripts + video generation, now you can also generate thumbnails, UGC stills, and ad creatives in the same workflow.\n\nClosing thought\nNano Banana‚Äôs real innovation isn‚Äôt prettier pictures‚Äîit‚Äôs reliable iteration.\nFor indie hackers, that means:\n\nLess wasted time üéØ\nMore creative experiments ‚ö°\nFaster shipping üöÄ\n\nüëâ It‚Äôs live now inside Textideo.

Both promise to revolutionize how we create video content, but which one deserves your time, money, and creative energy?\nUnderstanding the differences between https://textideo.com/model/veo3 and Sora is essential for content creators, marketers, and businesses looking to improve video production and choose the right tool.\n\nhttps://textideo.com/model/veo3\nTextideo Veo3 is built for creators who want both stunning visuals and integrated audio. Unlike many other AI video generators, Veo3 not only produces realistic 4K videos from text prompts but also automatically includes synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and music‚Äîmaking your videos truly immersive.\n\nOpenAI Sora\nSora focuses on flexibility and creative storytelling. It doesn‚Äôt include built-in audio, but it‚Äôs ideal for generating longer clips and complex multi-shot sequences, giving creators more freedom for editing and narrative work.\n\nFeature Comparison\n\n\nReal-World Examples\nPrompt: ‚ÄúA stylish woman walks down a Tokyo street filled with warm glowing neon and animated signage. She wears a black leather jacket, a long red dress, and black boots.‚Äù\n\nhttps://textideo.com/model/veo3 result: Stunning 4K footage with synchronized street sounds, footsteps, and ambient city noise‚Äîcreating a truly cinematic experience.\nSora result: Beautiful 1080p visuals with realistic lighting, but audio must be added separately.\n\n\nFeature Highlights\nAudio Capabilities: Veo3 includes synchronized audio by default, allowing you to create dialogue-driven or immersive scenes without post-production. Sora requires separate audio work.\nVisual Quality: Veo3 supports 4K resolution, offering cinematic textures and lifelike visuals. Sora is limited to 1080p, suitable for web and mobile content.\nPrompt Interpretation: Veo3 excels at realistic visuals, especially with detailed instructions on lighting, camera angles, and style. Sora shines with creative and stylized multi-character or dynamic scenes.\nEditing and Tools: Veo3 focuses on generation, with editing done afterward in tools like Powtoon. Sora provides built-in editing tools like Remix, Recut, and Storyboard for quick adjustments before export.\n\nPricing & Accessibility\nTextideo Veo3 requires no subscription! You can access it directly and start creating instantly‚Äîno monthly fees or complicated plans. Just generate your videos as needed without worrying about fixed costs or subscriptions.\nBy contrast, Sora is available through ChatGPT paid plans, where costs depend on how many videos you generate each month.\n\nWhen to Use https://textideo.com/model/veo3\nVeo3 is perfect for creators who need high-end, cinematic visuals with integrated audio. If your content demands 4K resolution, immersive sound, and consistent visuals, Veo3 is the best choice. It‚Äôs ideal for:\n\nProfessional film production\nBrand marketing and promotional content\nDialogue-driven or audio-heavy projects\nHigh-quality educational or corporate videos\n\n\nWhen Sora Works Best\nSora is better for flexible workflows, social media content, or rapid prototyping. It‚Äôs ideal for:\n\nCreative storytelling and narrative-driven projects\nSocial media videos (Instagram, TikTok)\nFast iterations, remixes, and quick adjustments\n\n\nBusiness Use Cases\n\nhttps://textideo.com/model/veo3: Perfect for premium campaigns, luxury brand ads, and corporate content requiring high production quality.\nSora: Suited for fast-paced, high-volume content creation, like social media marketing campaigns.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\nIf you want high-quality, audio-integrated, cinematic 4K videos, Textideo Veo3 is your go-to choice.\nIf you need flexible, fast, and social media-ready content, Sora is a strong option.\nReady to create amazing videos?

And she just launched DubX ‚Äî the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing.Here's Anuja on how she did it. üëáContentsBuilding a global tech business from IndiaStarting upBuilding a tech moatTargeting prosumersGood timingGrowth loops that workedCharging from day oneParting adviceWhat's next?Building a global tech business from IndiaI‚Äôve been a part of India‚Äôs buzzing startup ecosystem for almost a decade, working across different companies in the SaaS world. Over the years, I‚Äôve seen how the energy and ambition here have grown, and I‚Äôve always carried the dream of building something large and meaningful from India.In 2021, that dream took shape with Dubverse, a platform that helps creators, enterprises, and educators make their videos multilingual through AI-powered dubbing and subtitling. Our vision has always been simple but bold: to build a global technology business from India that competes at the highest stage.Today, Dubverse has a high 6-figure ARR. It has powered more than 4M videos and 11M dubbed minutes for creators worldwide, with a growing base of paying customers across industries. It‚Äôs the most exciting time to be building from India, and we‚Äôre just getting started!And I'm excited to announce the launch of DubX, the world‚Äôs first AI model built natively for dubbing. Until now, dubbing has been a clunky workflow: You‚Äôd input text, the system would convert it into speech, and that‚Äôs it. The voice was flat, the emotion got lost, and the translated video felt disconnected from the original. DubX changes that completely.Starting upThe early days of Dubverse were some of the most exciting. After my co-founder, Varshul, and I started, we quickly connected with two other builders who were experimenting in a very similar space. We met online, things just clicked, and they ended up moving cities to join us.That kind of serendipity gave the founding team a lot of momentum and belief in what we were building.Varshul and I had known each other for almost a decade. He‚Äôs the technical brain behind Dubverse, while I‚Äôm the one out talking to people and opening doors. Together, we built the first scrappy demo: a simple form where you could input a video and instantly see it translated into another language.This was back in 2020, before the AI hype cycle we‚Äôre in today. For most people, experiencing that ‚Äúmagic‚Äù for the first time felt almost unreal.I‚Äôll never forget one of our earliest demos with a creator. Midway through, they literally jumped out of their chair. They told us, ‚ÄúThis takes us weeks to do normally‚Ä¶ how are you doing it in real time?‚Äù Those moments validated that we were onto something. It gave our small team the energy to keep pushing forward until we found product-market fit.Building a tech moatFrom day one, our north star has been clear: If the internet is dominated by English, Dubverse should unlock everything non-English. That clarity shaped our tech decisions.In the beginning, we leaned on off-the-shelf models to validate the idea and test whether people would actually care about multilingual content. Once we saw the reactions and knew we were sitting on a goldmine, we went back to the drawing board: What could become our long-term moat?The answer was clear: building our own foundational speech models, especially for non-English languages.Voice quality is everything in dubbing. A dubbed video is only as good as the voiceover; if it‚Äôs not natural and engaging, nobody will consume it. That‚Äôs why we invested heavily in our own speech models, while also combining them with the best external models available to ensure creators get the smoothest experience.The evolution of the stack in just a few years has been mind-boggling. I still remember when Whisper came out. Within seven days, we had it integrated into Dubverse, instantly expanding language coverage and boosting transcription quality. Those moments have felt like riding the wave of AI innovation from the front row.The hardest challenge, from a technical perspective, has been data. We work in obscure languages, where high-quality datasets are scarce. But thanks to the wide variety of users on our platform, we‚Äôve been able to accumulate a corpus of more than 250,000 hours of data, which now powers our model training. That‚Äôs the kind of advantage that compounds over time.Targeting prosumersOne of the best decisions we ma",

And that's not because technology failed to advance, but because the advances were available to everyone. This is a distinction with a difference because for most of us, the purpose of work isn't just to do better in life. It's to do better than others.This is the leverage paradox. New technologies give us greater leverage to do more tasks better. But because this leverage is usually introduced into competitive environments, the result is that we end up having to work just as hard as before (if not harder) to remain competitive and keep up with the joneses.Enter AIBefore AI, we had to beat our competitors to the top of a staircase. It was tricky to climb because we had to ascend the steps manually, writing our own words, designing our own graphics, producing our own sounds, and coding our own software.Now, AI has turned that staircase into an escalator. Which is easier to climb! Yay!Except‚Ä¶ the leverage paradox means we all have to climb way higher to get to the top while competing against many more people.Those who understand this paradox ‚Äî not just intellectually but in a deep, intuitive way ‚Äî are the few who will make it to the top of the escalator. And those who don't will be the ones at the bottom.We're watching this unfold in real time:Claude 4 just refactored my entire codebase in one call.25 tool invocations. 3,000+ new lines. 12 brand new files.It modularized everything. Broke up monoliths. Cleaned up spaghetti.None of it worked.But boy was it beautiful. pic.twitter.com/wvmzh7IeAP‚Äî vas (@vasumanmoza) May 25, 2025We can all now produce blog posts, social media images, lifelike videos, and even halfbaked web apps in under 5 minutes.Problem is, the lion's share of this content is utter slop. Including stuff that might've been acceptable before the web got flooded by AI models that all talk the same, draw the same, think the same, and hallucinate the same.It feels like AI slop is everywhere:Search engine results pages filled with low-effort, SEO-farm articlesAn endless conveyor belt of Studio-Ghibli-style images on social feedsAI reply spam on every comment sectionFaceless channels on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram splicing lazy stock footage with same AI narration voices from ElevenLabsIt's easy to recognize this problem and to make snarky comments about it online. But as the saying goes:You aren't stuck in traffic; you are traffic.Resisting the urge to turn your brain off and output an additional unit of AI slop for the internet to roll its eyes at is hard. Because it's hard to adopt a new technology while continuing to put in the same hours and the same effort you put in before the technology was introduced.But that's why the leverage paradox is the leverage paradox. And that's why only a small fraction of us will get ahead with AI while the rest of us fall behind.Winning in the AI eraI have two pieces of advice for indie hackers who don't want to get seduced into complaceny with all the new AI tools:1. \"One-hundred-shot\" your projectsOne of the main reasons for all the AI slop is that everyone's trying to \"one-shot\" everything. Which is a huge missed opportunity.Generative AI gives us incredible first drafts to work with, but few people want to put in the additional effort it requires to make work that people love.So instead of trying to one-shot your next blog post",

The product is called Linguix ‚Äî it is an AI writing assistant for knowledge workers. My team and I worked on this product for almost seven years.Just recently, my cofounder and I were acqui-hired by a unicorn! Revenue at the time of the acquisition was around $170k ARR. I can't share the purchase price, but I think I can say that it was the same model that Google used with Windsurf: They bought out my technical cofounder and me, and the company remained a separate, active entity.Finding a way to exit the company was not easy at all!

None of those early ventures took off, but now he's going all-in on LaunchFastPro.Here's Andr√© on how he's doing it. üëáContents20 years in the makingOptimizing the stackThe marketing struggle as an engineerAdvice: Motivation follows actionWhat's next?20 years in the makingI've always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, even as a kid. In fact, I've only ever worked for a traditional company for about three months‚Äîthat's a story for another time.For roughly two decades, I've been teaching computer science and developing web applications for clients. That's what pays the bills.Teaching private classes for bachelor and masters students brings in roughly $3k/mo. And I make roughly $10k/mo building apps.Along the way, I've constantly scanned for problems worth solving. I've tested out plenty of ideas, but I struggled with execution and marketing. Until now. As the saying goes, \"An overnight success is years in the making.\"I launched and made six sales at 50‚Ç¨ each. It's not much, but validates the need. That's why I'm pouring everything into LaunchFastPro, including going from a solo proprietorship to an LLC type company.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

I currently run an AI voice company called Rosie, and we hit $1M ARR within eight months.The idea for Rosie came out of a pivot. I was running another product called Rally. We raised a seed round and a Series A, but unfortunately, that company just wasn't growing fast enough. We had gotten to a few hundred thousand in ARR and we were closing deals, but it just felt like everything was harder than it should have been.AI was popping, and I thought to myself, \"You know what? We've got a great team, we've got money in the bank, let's pivot and keep going.\"¬†\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

He just wanted to build a product in a single weekend, then he'd move on to the next idea.Three years later, Stagetimer is bringing in $20k/mo. He never made it to Idea #2.Here's Lukas on how he did it. üëáContentsFinding an ideaFrom side hustle to main hustleUgly and basicGetting quality feedbackGrowth via Google and PLGNailing the business modelKeep it simpleWhat's next?Finding an ideaI recorded every idea I had for two years. Everything from \"Funny Posters for Toilet Doors\" to \"Website Generator for Restaurants.\"I thought there were 2-3 promising ideas. But I decided to start with the simplest idea.The simplest idea was one that came to me during a visit to a friend's video studio. I watched him jump up, run to another room to start a timer on an old laptop, then dash back to his video mixer. I thought, \"Surely there's a better solution\" ‚Äî but when I searched online, I only found outdated desktop software that looked like Windows 98.As a web developer, this seemed like such an easy problem to solve. I had always wanted to build my own product anyway, so I put it on that idea list. And since it was simple enough to build in a weekend, that's what I eventually started withI never got to idea number two.\n        \n          \n        \n        \n          Create a Free Account\n          To read the rest of this article, you'll need to subscribe to Indie Hackers.\n          The best part is: subscribing is free!\n          Indie Hacker members get expanded access to more of our content, including articles and our database of ideas.\n          You'll also get access to the community, including the ability talk to other indie hackers and create a profile for yourself.\n        \n        \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n                  About the\n                  Author\n                \n                \n                  \n                      \n                        \n                      \n                    \n                      \n                      James Fleischmann\n                    \n                      \n                          \n  \n\n                        @JamesOfTheDrum\n                      \n                  \n                    \n                      I've been writing for Indie Hackers for the better part of a decade.

A day later, one subscription was cancelled and I instantly dropped below $500 again :)\nI started developing the project in June 2024, and launched it for the first time in September 2024 (under a different name, Referral Page). The launch was unsuccessful, so I stopped working on it. But in November, I decided to give it a second chance and after improving and changing the positioning, I launched it again and failed again (2 paid customers appeared, but 1 cancel almost immediately)\nI don‚Äôt know why, but this did not stop me and in April 2025 I decided to launch it again with new positioning and this time it was a little successful. Here, the fact that I added lifetime deals also played a role and perhaps this attracted more attention.\nIn May, I refused lifetime deals to focus on the growth of MRR (at that time it was $48). On lifetime deals in April - May, I earned $5.5k, which for me was a sufficient signal to focus on the development of this product.\nAnd after another 3 months, the MRR reached $500 (and 1 day after dropped to $468).\nIt‚Äôs a good reminder that in micro-SaaS, milestones are not a straight line up.\nRevenue fluctuates, churn happens, and ‚Äú$X MRR‚Äù is never permanent until you‚Äôre well past it.\nWhat helped me get here:\n\nShipping fast and often (small but constant updates)\nFocusing on one distribution channel at a time (for me: social media)\nBuilding trust by showing real screenshots and transparent progress\n\nIf you‚Äôre building your own SaaS: don‚Äôt get discouraged when numbers move backward. Progress is rarely linear.\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n\n    \n\n\n        \n\n\n            \n                \n    \n          \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n          \n              AlexBelogubov\n          \n\n\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            \n          \n\n\n\n            \n              on August 25, 2025\n            \n        \n\n\n        \n          \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n    2\n\n\n          \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n    0\n    \n\n\n          \n    \n  \n\n    Share\n\n\n\n        \n      \n\n        \n          \n    \n    \n      Say something nice to AlexBelogubov‚Ä¶\n    \n\n  \n      \n        Post Comment\n      \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n        \n    Trending on Indie Hackers\n  \n\n  \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              üöÄ From Idea to Launch: How I Built Textideo ‚Äî A No-Login, Pay-As-You-Go AI Video Generation Platform\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              48 comments\n                \n  \n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              Wan2.2 ‚Äî Text-to-Image Generation\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              38 comments\n                \n  \n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              Why Most SaaS Content Misses (And How to Fix It)\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              31 comments\n                \n  \n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              How We Built Flight: Affordable Email Marketing Tool\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              28 comments\n                \n  \n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              From 200+ Widgets to Infinite Customization: Our Journey to Embeddable\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              26 comments\n                \n  \n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n            \n          \n            \n              How I Used Voice-Changing Tech to Keep My Long-Distance Relationship Exciting ‚Äî and Built a Website for It\n            \n            \n                \n  \n    \n\n  \n\n              21 comments",

For indie hackers who build in public and move fast, voice AI offers a new canvas for creative product design. This article synthesizes insights from recent voice-AI case studies, growing market statistics, and lessons learned from the indie hacker community. We‚Äôll also look at how the team at Cores Connect and their upcoming Hilda platform are positioning themselves in this emerging landscape.\nFrom manual grind to productized AI\nOn IndieHackers, founders often document how manual experiments blossom into products. One popular post I saw described a design‚Äëroast service that began as a free Dribbble feedback channel and evolved into a $1‚ÄØM ARR design kit within eight months.\nThe pattern is familiar:\nStart manually to understand the problem.\n‚Üí Listen to your customers and iterate quickly.\n‚Üí Productize the parts that work and automate the rest.\nThis trajectory isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics. It‚Äôs about embracing the friction of manual processes to find what people really value. When the pain points are clear, technology ‚Äî including AI ‚Äî can scale the solution.\nI believe voice AI follows the same path. The earliest voice agents were scripted IVR menus. Today, machine learning enables conversational agents that understand intent, respond naturally, and learn from interactions. Businesses are repurposing human hours at scale; for example, ConverseNow reports handling over 2‚ÄØmillion conversations per month and repurposing 83‚ÄØthousand labor hours. That level of automation comes only after understanding the manual workflow in detail.\nVoice AI has taken the market by storm and the stats show it:\nMarket research suggests that the global voice recognition market, valued at roughly $12‚ÄØbillion in 2022, is projected to reach close to $50‚ÄØbillion by 2029. Analysts estimate there were around 8.4‚ÄØbillion digital voice assistants in use by 2024, more assistants than people. This proliferation shows that consumers are comfortable speaking to devices and are beginning to expect voice interfaces beyond the smart speaker.\nA 2025 analysis of AI voice dialers found that companies adopting voice AI for customer communications saw reductions in handling time and higher conversion rates. These improvements come from automating routine conversations and triaging more complex calls to human agents.\nPlatforms like PreCallAI promise indie‚Äëfriendly tooling: AI assistants can be launched ‚Äúin days, not months‚Äù and respond in under 300‚ÄØmilliseconds, producing human‚Äëlike conversations. Pay‚Äëas‚Äëyou‚Äëuse pricing and CRM integration mean startups can test voice flows without enterprise budgets. Clients reportedly see a threefold return on investment within 30‚ÄØdays thanks to higher conversions and lower labor costs.\nVoice AI changes who does the work. Restaurants adopting voice‚Äëordering systems handle orders 24/7 without hiring extra staff. In the hospitality sector, companies like ConverseNow free up tens of thousands of human hours per month, letting teams focus on hospitality rather than taking orders. In customer support, voice AI with sub‚Äë300‚ÄØms response times delivers ‚Äúconversations so natural, customers can‚Äôt tell‚Äù.\nLinguistics and writing: crafting voices that sound human\nUnlike chatbots, voice AI must handle prosody, accents, and hesitation. Building a voice agent is as much about linguistics as code. Effective agents model intent rather than keywords, adapt tone and persona to reflect brand personality, and learn from feedback loops, like a good writer iterates drafts, a voice AI refines its language models based on real interactions.\nFor people interested in writing and linguistics, voice AI opens a unique niche: designing dialogue flows that feel empathetic while fulfilling a function. It‚Äôs not just about copywriting; it‚Äôs about capturing the rhythm of conversation and embedding it into code.\nWith the startup I‚Äôve been working on, we‚Äôve capitalized on this rising market to deliver a seamless customer experience. By abstracting the complexity of speech recognition, natural language understanding, and knowledge retrieval, ‚ÄòHilda‚Äô aims to let indie founders focus on problem‚Äësolving and user experience instead of infrastructure. I‚Äôll be documenting my journey with it here!\nIf you want to dive into Voice AI yourselve",
