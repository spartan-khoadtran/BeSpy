This is the gpt 4 moment for image editing models.
Nano banana aka gemini 2.5 flash is insanely good.
It made a 171 elo point jump in lmarena!Just search nano banana on Twitter to see the crazy results.
An example.

I've been testing it for several weeks. It can produce results that are truly epic, but it's still a case of rerolling the prompt a dozen times to get an image you can use. It's not God. It's definitely an enormous step though, and totally SOTA.reply...

I've been building a general browser agent myself, and I’ve found the biggest bottleneck in these systems isn’t capability demos but long-running reliability.Tools like Manus / GPT Agent Mode / BrowserUse / Claude’s Chrome control typically make an LLM call per action/decision. That piles up latency, cost, and fragility as the DOM shifts, sessions expire, and sites rate-limit. Eventually you hit prompt-injection landmines or lose context and the run stalls.I am approaching browser agents differently: record once, replay fast. We capture HTML snapshots + click targets + short voice notes to build a deterministic plan, then only use an LLM for rare ambiguities or recovery. That makes multi-hour jobs feasible. Concretely, users run things like:Recruiter sourcing for hours at a stretchSEO crawls: gather metadata → update internal dashboard → email a reportBulk LinkedIn connection flows with lightweight personalizationEven long web-testing runsA stress test I like (can share code/method):
“Find 100+ GitHub profiles in Bangalore strong in Python + Java, extract links + metadata, and de-dupe.” Most per-step-LLM agents drift or stall after a few minutes due to DOM churn, pagination loops, or rate limits. A record-→-replay plan with checkpoints + idempotent steps tends to survive.I’d benchmark on:Throughput over time (actions/min sustained for 30–60+ mins)End-to-end success rate on multi-page flows with infinite scroll/paginationResume semantics (crash → restart without duplicates)Selector robustness (resilient to minor DOM changes)Cost per 1,000 actionsDisclosure: I am the founder of 100x.bot (record-to-agent, long-run reliability focus). I’m putting together a public benchmark with the scenario above + a few gnarlier ones (auth walls, rate-limit backoff, content hashing for dedupe). If there’s interest, I can post the methodology and harness here so results are apples-to-apples.reply

Wish her the best with this. Intel staying competitive in GPUs can only benefit the consumer. Those who want a mid-tier graphic card, without paying to compete with AI use cases, may not a huge group, but we do exist! Those who use desktop Linux may be a small group among that small group, but we do...

>  When he and his colleagues looked at the individuals’ immune cells, they could see encounters with all sorts of viruses—flu, measles, mumps, chickenpox. But the patients had never reported any overt signs of infection or illness.Given that the article goes on to talk about mild persistent inflammation, is it possible that these individuals are sometimes asymptomatic but still capable of carrying/transmitting viruses at least temporarily? The article talks about potentially immunizing healthcare workers during a future pandemic, but if this was just allowing people to never develop symptoms (and not have to leave work) while having low-grade infections, would we accidentally create a work-force of Typhoid Marys?reply

I think that the negativity here is unfortunate. The reality is that it’s very hard to see a normal VC level return on the $100M+ Elon and friends have invested here. And don’t let anyone fool you - this is the fundamental reason the BCI field has moved slowly.If Neuralink proceeds to a scenario where quadriplegic patients can get reliable (ie lifelong) control of their computers for less than $100k that will be a huge win for them for a cost that no one else was willing to pay.To be clear, at that order of magnitude they might make back their investment, but it won’t be 10x or 100x, and the potential healthy-brain-connected-to-the-AI play is much less rooted in reality than Teslas all becoming taxis.Worst case scenario is that Elon loses interest and pulls the plug and Mr Arbaugh loses continued tech support a la a google product. I think that’s the one question I wish the author had asked…reply

**Post Text:**
They really fail to explain a key point here. The reason you colocate this with a desalination plant is because you use the super-salty wastewater from desalination as the salty side of the osmosis power plant. Then you find some wastewater which is low in salt (such as semi-treated sewage), and use that as the fresh side of the osmosis power plant.The end result is that the salty wastewater is partially diluted, which means it has a lower environmental impact when it is discharged to the ocean.reply

#### Comment 2 by tempestn:
Yeah, this is the coolest part. The leftover brine from desalination is generally just a problem. It's harmful to the marine habitat if you just put it back into the ocean, and there isn't a lot else good to be done with it. (Basically you have to dilute it first.) But this way you get useful work o...
