    "selftext": "10 months ago I launched [Buildpad](https://buildpad.io). It’s a platform where users research and build their products. It went on to make $46,000 which is kinda insane for me to think about.\n\nI was very new to marketing when launching it. The main channels I picked were X, Reddit, but also Product Hunt of course. So I just started building a following together with my app as it grew. This is a “hack” imo as long as you build a good or at least interesting product. As my product grew so did my following. It was like a self-feeding cycle.\n\nHere are my stats so far:\n\n* 10k+ total signups\n* 370 active paying subscribers\n* $46,000 revenue\n* 30k+ unique website visitors per month\n\nThis was unimaginable to me a couple of months ago and I’m genuinely thankful for reaching this point. But of course I want to continue growing and taking this even further. There’s no plan to stop and now I’m thinking about how to take this to $50k/mo and then $100k/mo.\n\nThe path I see forward from here is finding a marketing channel that I can scale. I’m looking at different ways of producing content right now for example. Because if I can figure it out myself first then I can start paying others to create content for me and that’s where I can see crazy scaling start happening. I will experiment both with content in written format and video format to see what works best. Paying others to create content is also where it becomes more passive for me.\n\nYou shouldn’t underestimate how far you can get simply by setting your aim very high and then working towards that and improving every day as you go. I’m super excited for my journey coming up in these next few months. If you’re on this same journey with me, keep going! We’re all gonna make it.",

That’s fair enough, but makes me a bit cautious - kinda feels like they’re selling shovels in a gold rush.\n\nHas anyone here used Buildpad to validate a new or existing idea that eventually made over $1k a month?\n\nAnd if yes, do you think you could’ve done it just as well without it?",

I am looking for 10 early beta users at lifetime offer for $100 and help me in shaping the product by feedback and testimonials.",
