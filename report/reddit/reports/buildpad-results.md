10 months ago I launched [Buildpad](https://buildpad.io). It’s a platform where users research and build their products. It went on to make $46,000 which is kinda insane for me to think about.

I was very new to marketing when launching it. The main channels I picked were X, Reddit, but also Product Hunt of course. So I just started building a following together with my app as it grew. This is a “hack” imo as long as you build a good or at least interesting product. As my product grew so did my ...

### Content

I’ve seen the Buildpad founders post in a few subreddits about how much they’ve made and how well they’re doing.

They mostly lead with advice but quite clear its part of their marketing. That’s fair enough, but makes me a bit cautious - kinda feels like they’re selling shovels in a gold rush.

Has anyone here used Buildpad to validate a new or existing idea that eventually made over $1k a month?

And if yes, do you think you could’ve done it just as well without it?

### Content

I am planning to build a microsaas and was researching for ideas by analysing user complaints and gaps and came across so many bitly complaints, I know there are lots of alternatives and most of them historically gets shutdown because of maintenance complexity. 

But after analysing the pain points, I think there is a good opportunity in SMB and providing lean solution at affordable, transparent and predictable pricing will be a fair deal, plus I don't need to get millions of customers just 100 ...
