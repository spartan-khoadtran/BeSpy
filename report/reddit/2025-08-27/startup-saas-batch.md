### Content

Last month, I launched Leadmore AI, an application designed to help brands with their Reddit marketing and guide them in finding their first users. It quickly gained paying customers and has been growing steadily. Now it has brought in $3,000 in revenue.
    
      1 year ago, I wanted to build a tool of my own and got users. I used to think that if I just built a cool product, users would come to me.I tried various methods, but they were all ineffective.
    
      Then I realized I was making a fundamental mistake: I was solving a fictional problem.
    
      So, I decided to start over with a completely different strategy. Instead of making assumptions, I went looking for real pain. I dove deep into the intense discussions and seemingly negative complaints on Reddit, because I knew that genuine debate reveals real pain points, and pain points mean people are willing to pay for a solution.
    
      I discovered that many startups and individuals were struggling with Reddit marketing. They spent a lot of time searching for the right communities and trying to figure out each subreddit's rules, often with little success. They were even getting rejected by communities due to misunderstandings. I realized this was a massive market that lacked a dedicated, efficient solution.
    
      I spent several months coding and analyzing over 100,000 subreddits, 500,000 posts, and 3 million comments to ensure my tool could help users solve the most critical problem: finding the right communities.
    
      This feature will be live this week. For the content publishing feature that's already live, I didn't offer a free trial. I charged my first customers a minimum of $9.90 (now $4.90). I understood that those unwilling to pay $9.90 weren't my real customers. Paying creates a commitment; they will actually use your product, give honest feedback, and help me make it better.
    
      I didn't send a single cold email or run any ads. I actively participated in startup-related communities like r/saas and r/sideproject, sharing my insights on Reddit marketing and answering questions. When someone posted about struggling to find a problem worth solving, I would DM them directly to let them know I had built a tool specifically for that challenge.
    
      Here are the results so far:
    
        
      
      Website visitors: 1.4k+
    
    
      
      Registered users: 300+
    
    
      
      Paying customers: 100+
    
    
      
      Monthly revenue: $3,000+
    
    
      
      These results prove that the factors that truly drive results are:
    
        
      
      Positioning over features. My product is not more technically complex than the large research platforms. But it’s positioned to specifically solve a startup’s pain point in Reddit marketing. This focus allows me to charge a premium.
    
    
      
      Competition validates the market. When I saw others building similar tools, it made me excited, not scared. It proved that founders were already paying for this kind of solution.
    
    
      
      If you're also looking for a problem worth solving or are currently struggling, my advice is to go to the communities where people are actively debating and complaining. That's where real opportunities are hidden.
    
      If you're trying to do Reddit marketing or are just curious, feel free to check my tool out. You can also join r/LeadmoreAI for the latest updates.
