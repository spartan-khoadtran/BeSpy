Similar to Twitter and Indiehacker, I want to implement something can run with script and playwright to get data from https://news.ycombinator.com/

I will give you a keyword and then search it in hackernews

You will open each post/news/thread/story etc and get full content, the output format must be in json by default but support markdown

Implement and test with they keyword buildpad, if the result is 0 results then you implement it wrong, remember to fix and correct it until it works

The code must be place inside folder scripts/hackernews/


I want to have another mode that run scan through hackernews and get some trending post (feel free to think how to evaluate a post is trending in hackernews) in last n days (default is 2)
